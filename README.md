### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) for database ORM
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for local database

### Commands

This `Turborepo` already configured useful commands for all your apps and packages.

#### Build

```bash
# Will build all the app & packages with the supported `build` script.
pnpm run build

# ℹ️ If you plan to only build apps individually,
# Please make sure you've built the packages first.
```

#### Develop

```bash
# Will run the development server for all the app & packages with the supported `dev` script.
pnpm run dev
```

#### test

```bash
# Will launch a test suites for all the app & packages with the supported `test` script.
pnpm run test

# See `@repo/jest-config` to customize the behavior.
```

#### Lint

```bash
# Will lint all the app & packages with the supported `lint` script.
# See `@repo/eslint-config` to customize the behavior.
pnpm run lint
```

#### Format

```bash
# Will format all the supported `.ts,.js,json,.tsx,.jsx` files.
# See `@repo/eslint-config/prettier-base.js` to customize the behavior.
pnpm format
```

### Database

We use [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) to manage & access our database. As such you will need a database for this project, either locally or hosted in the cloud.

To make this process easier, we offer a [`docker-compose.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to deploy a PostgreSQL server locally with a new database named `turborepo`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Once deployed you will need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in order for Prisma to have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to access.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you added a custom database name, or use a cloud based database, you will need to update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` accordingly.

Once deployed & up & running, you will need to create & deploy migrations to your database to add the necessary tables. This can be done using [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate):

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

If you need to push any existing migrations to the database, you can use either the Prisma db push or the Prisma migrate deploy command(s):

```bash
pnpm run prisma:push

# OR

pnpm run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

There is slight difference between the two commands & [Prisma offers a breakdown on which command is best to use](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push#choosing-db-push-or-prisma-migrate).
